# Maharashtra Construction Demand Analysis
## Project Overview

This project analyzes construction material demand across Maharashtra to uncover regional consumption patterns, pricing trends, and supply-demand concentration.

Using SQL for data transformation and aggregation, and Tableau for dashboard visualization, the analysis identifies actionable insights for distributors, suppliers, and strategic planners in the construction ecosystem.

The study focuses on:

District-wise demand concentration

Material category performance

Urban vs semi-urban consumption trends

Seasonal and pricing dynamics

## Business Objective

To derive data-driven insights that can support:

Inventory optimization

Regional expansion strategy

Pricing and margin decisions

Channel allocation planning

## Tools & Technologies

SQL (Data Cleaning & Aggregation)

Excel (Data Validation & Transformation)

Tableau (Interactive Dashboard Development)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## Key Insights

Top 3 districts contribute majority of material demand concentration

Cement & steel categories dominate total volume share

Urban clusters show higher pricing consistency vs rural markets

Demand variability suggests opportunity for decentralized warehousing

## Strategic Recommendations

Inventory Optimization
Prioritize stocking in high-demand districts to reduce lead times and logistics cost.

Targeted Market Expansion
Focus channel development in emerging Tier-2 districts with rising demand trends.

Dynamic Pricing Strategy
Adjust pricing in high-demand regions to protect margins while maintaining competitiveness.

Supply Chain Efficiency
Consider regional warehousing hubs to reduce distribution inefficiencies.

## Project Outcome

This project demonstrates:

SQL proficiency in structured data analysis

Dashboard storytelling capability

Business insight extraction from raw operational data

Strategic thinking aligned with consulting frameworks
